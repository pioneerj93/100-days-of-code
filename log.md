# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I wrote a bare bones web site.

**Thoughts:** My current HTML/CSS knowledge is rudimentary, at best. However, I feel optimisitic about what I can accomplish if I diligently learn and create every day. Coding commences tomorrow.
